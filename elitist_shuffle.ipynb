In today's high pace user experience if `T` is even a few hours, let alone a day, the user can get bored of the same content displayed every time it opens the application during the period `T`. There can be many ways this scenario can happen but imagine the user opens the application and doesn't like the recommended items and is too lazy or busy to scroll or search for something else, then minutes after it opens it again to find exactly the same content as before. This could be a killing factor for user retention.\n",

By default the algorithm produces a uniform shuffle of an array in which every permutation is equally likely. This means that an item has equal probability to end up in any position. (by the way numpy uses the same [algorithm](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/random/mtrand/mtrand.pyx#L4852)).

    "This is actually a simple approach, I shuffle the items by choosing items with a weighted probability (this is the same as sampling from a [multinomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution) without replacement). I won't go into the details but the function [`numpy.random.choice`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) with the parameter `replace=False` does what we want, is just a matter of choosing the appropriate weight probabilities. In this case I choose to set the weights by transforming the reverse position as `np.linspace(1, 0, num=len(items), endpoint=False)` (you might be tempted to use `np.arange(len(items), 0, step=-1)` which is not numerically robust for a big `inequality` parameter). Then I introduce a parameter called `inequality` as a knob to tune the weight probability difference between positions."
